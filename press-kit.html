  <h2>Advance Praise for <cite class="italic">You Will Win The Future</cite></h2>
  </div>
  <p>"Like the best speculative fiction, Arthur Smid's <cite class="italic">You Will Win The Future</cite> had me vacillating between feeling that the world described was quite familiar and then trying to reassure myself that it was a preposterous exaggeration. If this isn't our world, quite, it certainly shines a light on and amplifies our world's tendencies. I traveled along with these sincere, questioning characters and found myself so suspicious and fearful—yet ultimately hopeful that there may still be people who can use technology's inhuman tools to return us to a more human state." —<span class="bold">Peter Rock</span>, author of <cite class="italic">My Abandonment</cite>, adapted into the award-winning movie <cite class="italic">Leave No Trace</cite></p>
  <br><p>"An ambitious and revealing novel." —<span class="bold">Beth Lyons</span>, editor and co-founder of Northwest Quest Publishers</p>
  <br><p>"As philosophical as it is playful, a novel that envisions gamified cities in a gamified world of the not-so-distant future—a brow-furrowing critique of humankind's messy relationship with technology and the capitalism of catastrophe." —<span class="bold">Evan P. Schneider</span>, author of <cite class="italic">A Simple Machine, Like the Lever</cite></p>
  <br><p>"A clear picture of how technology, company culture, and prosperity could be redefined in the near future." —<span class="bold">Eric Corey Freed</span>, architect and principal of organicARCHITECT</p>
  <br><p>"Something rare: a software development drama that escalates into a pensive allegory for the gamification of capital and the subjugated positions many American cities are in because of it. Think Fortnite for real estate." —<span class="bold">Matt Dan</span>, artist and co-founder of Night Time Science</p>
  <br><p>"This city blazes a new path of equitable economic opportunity." —<span class="bold">Holly Balcom</span>, PDX YIMBY housing advocate</p>
  <br><p>"A reinvention of how technology and civics (and really everything) intersect." —<span class="bold">Mike Merrill</span>, the world's first publicly traded person</p>
  <br><p>"Arthur’s book gives an insightful perspective on the transformative power of technology, and the urgent need for those of us working in the tech industry to put our talents to use for democracy and equality, not extraction and manipulation." —<span class="bold">Petter Joelson</span>, co-founder and co-director of Digidem Lab, a nonprofit based in Sweden developing methods and tools for participatory democracy</p>
  <br><p>"Explores big ideas about what it means to be a citizen when individuals only in it for themselves are allowed to make the rules for everyone. Thoughtful, speculative takes on finance, healthcare, and modern work culture." —<span class="bold">Mike Vogel</span>, writer and filmmaker, creator of <cite class="italic">Phrenic</cite></p>
  <br><p>"Visionary!" —<span class="bold">Sarah Murray</span>, founder of Place Technologies</p>
  <br><p>"Fascinating and satiric." —<span class="bold">Cornelius Swart</span>, director and producer of <cite class="italic">Priced Out: 15 Years of Gentrification in Portland, Oregon</cite></p>
  <br><p>"A rare civic-minded SF novel that doesn’t depend on the crutch of a jury-rigged dystopia to bear the weight of its social critique." —<span class="bold">David W. Edwards</span>, former Oregon legislator and the creator of <cite class="italic">Nightscape</cite></p>
  <br><p>"Equal parts terrifying and optimistic." —<span class="bold">Michael Heald</span>, author of <cite class="italic">Goodbye to the Nervous Apprehension</cite></p>
  <br><p>"Persistently intelligent and insightful." —<span class="bold">Justin Hocking</span>, author of <cite class="italic">The Great Floodgates of the Wonderworld</cite>, winner of the 2015 Oregon Book Award for Creative Nonfiction</p>
  <br><p>"An ambitious debut novel that explores the collision of technology and money, and asks whether it’s possible to redefine both for the betterment of all." —<span class="bold">David Wolman</span>, author of <cite class="italic">The End of Money</cite></p>
  <br><p>"Realistically compelling novel about a possible path to a more just future." —<span class="bold">Carl Abbott</span>, professor emeritus of Urban Studies and Planning at Portland State University and author of <cite class="italic">Imagining Urban Futures: Cities in Science Fiction and What We Might Learn from Them</cite></p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  </div>
  <p>ENTERING THE FINAL FRONTIER of economic mobility, Shane scores a job in tech. They merge a massively multi-player online video game with an investment fund to buy up property after the Cascadia earthquake. The founders are betting on disaster and as Shane gets exposed to the sociopaths inside the company, he begins to passively rebel—but he’s very reluctant to quit. After years of being unable to leverage an indie game he made into a real business, this is his chance to learn. It’s an opportunity to move out of his folks’ house, and his partner does truly need the company health plan. Wealth is their only protection in 21st century America. And yet Shane would rather help create a platform for digital work with real benefits, social solidarity and mutual aid. Can humankind create a new economy?</p>
